# NGNX: Grandpa's Revenge

The Solana meme coin that's already retired. While Pepe was farming airdrops, $NGNX was farming grandkids and yelling at clouds. 0/0 taxes, LP burned, contract renounced—pure boomer chaos.

## Tokenomics
- **Total Supply**: 420,690,000,000 $NGNX
- **Taxes**: 0% buy / 0% sell (we're not your ex)
- **Liquidity**: 100% added & torched 🔥
- **Contract**: Renounced at birth—no rugs here
- **Max TX/Wallet**: Unlimited degen fuel

## Roadmap (Real Talk)
- **Phase 1** ✓ Launch, burn LP, renounce everything
- **Phase 2** → Raid every DEX with Windows XP vibes
- **Phase 3** → NFT drop: NGNX in a rocket-walker
- **Phase 4** → Boomer diss track on SoundCloud (ft. vinyl scratches)
- **Phase 5** → Eternal Caymans nap (frog wins)
